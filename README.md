### Hi there and welcome to my profile 🧙‍♂️

Here you can view my public projects.

Currently I am developing in flutter.

Most of my work is invested in my smart home startup which is privet (and I plan to make open in the future) not to be confused with my repo Smart-Power-Outlet,
so for now you will only see the desserts 🍧.


Feel free to take a look at some of my projects:

[Parking-lot](https://github.com/guyluz11/parking-lot)  🚧 🚗 🏍️ - Arduino script for a parking lot mechanism with 2 gates (entrance and exit) 🚧 🚜 🚕.

[ClapInator](https://github.com/guyluz11/ClapInator)  👏🏾 👏🏾 💡 - Clap twice to change device state (code for Arduino) .

[Ultrasonic-thief-capture](https://github.com/guyluz11/ultrasonic-thief-capture) 🕵️ - Raspberry Pi script to capture video of all the people that enters the room.

[Scripts](https://github.com/guyluz11/Scripts)  🐲 - maybe you will found a script that will help you on your journey.
